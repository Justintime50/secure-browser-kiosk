# secure-kiosk-browser
A simple app that opens and closes Chrome in incognito mode asking if the user needs more time after a timeout.

## Usage
1. Ensure the scripts are executable.
2. Either run them as standalone scripts or use `Automator` to package them into an app and add the app as a Login Item to a standard account therefore creating a Kiosk that can't be quit.
